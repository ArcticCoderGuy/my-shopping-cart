# 🛒 My Shopping Cart

This is a school project where I am building a simple "shopping cart" web application to learn the basics of version control, project structure, and frontend/backend workflow. The project is built from scratch and follows a clear step-by-step development process.

## 👨‍🎓 Project Background

As a student, I started this project locally to understand how real-world development workflows function — from local setup to GitHub integration. The primary goal is to learn the fundamentals of:

- Project initialization
- Git and GitHub workflow
- Markdown documentation
- Code structure and commits

---

## ✅ What I've Done So Far

### 🔹 Local Setup

- Created a project folder: `my-shopping-cart`
- Initialized Git locally using `git init -b main`
- Created an initial `README.md` file with `New-Item` in PowerShell
- Wrote and staged initial content with `git add .`
- Committed the first version: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`

### 🔹 GitHub Integration

- Created an **empty** GitHub repository (no README/gitignore)
- Connected the local repo using:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/ArcticCoderGuy/my-shopping-cart.git
